# Capstone-Project
Code Academy Project

I changed some design choices:
Overall design works on all browsersas well as all mobiles platforms as tested in Google Chrome.
Added Google analytics script. 
Added a Favicon. In hindsight I should have chosen the school logo instead of a star.

I chose Roboto , sans-serif  font. Roboto has a dual nature, the font features friendly and open curves. While some grotesks distort 
their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm,Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. 
This makes for a more natural reading rhythm.

I chose a Monochromatic Color Scheme. My thoughts were blue gives a more professional outlook to education and easy on the eye. 

Added a meta viewport,so that the browser will (hopefully) render the width of the page at the width of its own screen.
So if that screen is 320px wide, the browser window will be 320px wide, rather than way zoomed out and showing 960px 
(or whatever that device does by default, in lieu of a responsive meta tag).


Added a meta description which specifies a description of the page. 
Search engines can pick up this description to show with the results of searches
